# Earthsung By Jackson - Atom 1.13 +

A port of [Dayle Rees](http://daylerees.github.io)' Earthsong theme for Atom.

Forked from [JesseLeite](https://github.com/JesseLeite/earthsung-by-jackson-syntax-atom) and regularly updated.

## UI Integration

This theme best integrates with Atom's [One Dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).  By default, UI is left untouched.  If you want the modified UI (as shown in the screenshot above) for better colour matching between UI syntax theme, add the following line to your Init Script and reload Atom.

```coffee
document.body.classList.add('earthsung-modify-ui')
```
